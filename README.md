PowerShell
==========

PowerShell Modules and files

Modules\Logger -> Contains a module to handle generating log files with varying names.
Modules\MSbuild -> Contains functions for running MSBuild with most common defaults for what I usually do, but parametrized so the defaults can be overriden, including a function to recurse a solution folder.
Modules\TeamFoundation -> Contains functions for handling Workspaces, Checkins and other stuff. Relies on having Team Explorer Everywhere installed.
Modules\XUnit -> Command line runner for XUnit tests.
